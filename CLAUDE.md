This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Application Overview

BookSharingWebAPI is the backend for a **community-based book lending platform** that enables users to share physical books with others in their communities. The API facilitates the entire borrowing lifecycle from discovery to return, with built-in chat, notifications, and dispute resolution.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Discover books available in your communities
- Request to borrow books from other members
- Track lending/borrowing status through a structured workflow
- Communicate with lenders/borrowers via real-time chat
- Manage your personal library and share availability

**Technology Stack:**
- **ASP.NET Core 8.0** - Minimal APIs pattern
- **PostgreSQL 15** - Relational database (via Docker)
- **Entity Framework Core 9.0.8** - ORM with Code-First migrations
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** - User management and authentication
- **JWT Authentication** - Access tokens (24h) + refresh tokens (7d)
- **SignalR** - WebSocket-based real-time messaging
- **OpenLibrary API** - External book search integration
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerized deployment

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `dotnet build BookSharingApp.csproj` - Build the application (use specific project file due to .sln presence)
- `dotnet run` - Run the application (starts on https://localhost:7061 and http://localhost:5155)
- `dotnet run --launch-profile http` - Run with HTTP only
- `dotnet run --launch-profile https` - Run with HTTPS (default)

### Testing
- No test framework is currently configured in this project

### Package Management
- `dotnet restore` - Restore NuGet packages
- `dotnet add package <PackageName>` - Add a new package

### Local Development Setup
For local PostgreSQL development without Docker, set up user secrets for secure credential storage:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=booksharingdb;Username=bookuser;Password=YOUR_LOCAL_PASSWORD"
dotnet user-secrets set "JWT:Key" "YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_LOCAL_PASSWORD` with your local PostgreSQL password and `YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY` with a secure 32+ character key for JWT token signing. This keeps credentials out of source control while allowing local development.

**Prerequisites for local development:**
1. Install PostgreSQL locally
2. Connect as postgres superuser: `sudo -i -u postgres psql`
3. Create database: `CREATE DATABASE booksharingdb;`
4. Create user: `CREATE USER bookuser WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';`
5. Grant database permissions: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE booksharingdb TO bookuser;`
6. Connect to the database: `\c booksharingdb`
7. Grant schema permissions (required for PostgreSQL 15+):
   ```sql
   GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO bookuser;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO bookuser;
   ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO bookuser;
   ```
8. Exit PostgreSQL: `\q`
9. Set user secrets (commands above)
10. Run with `dotnet run`

### Docker Commands

#### First Time Setup
- `cp .env.example .env` - Copy environment template (required for local development)
- Edit `.env` file with your preferred database credentials

#### Running the Application
- `docker build -t booksharing-api .` - Build Docker image
- `docker run -p 3000:8080 booksharing-api` - Run container on port 3000
- `docker-compose --profile prod up` - Start with docker-compose (production mode, port 3000)
- `docker-compose --profile dev up` - Start with docker-compose (development mode, port 3001)
- `docker-compose down` - Stop and remove containers
- `docker-compose up --build` - Rebuild and start containers

### Key Components

1. **Minimal API Architecture**: Uses ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs with static extension methods for endpoint mapping
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated into service classes (ShareService, NotificationService, etc.)
3. **Entity Framework Core**: PostgreSQL database with Code-First migrations
4. **Dependency Injection**: Services, DbContext, and repositories registered in DI container
5. **Swagger Integration**: Configured for development environment with OpenAPI documentation
6. **SignalR Hub**: Real-time WebSocket communication for chat functionality

### Data Flow
- HTTP requests → Endpoints → Services → DbContext → PostgreSQL
- Real-time chat: SignalR Hub → ChatHub → Broadcast to connected clients
- Authentication: JWT middleware validates tokens before reaching endpoints

## Core Entities & Domain Model

### User
- Unique identifier (GUID)
- Profile: email, firstName, lastName, fullName
- Authentication via ASP.NET Core Identity with JWT tokens
- Can join multiple communities
- Managed by ASP.NET Core Identity tables

### Book
- Basic book information: id, title, author, thumbnailUrl
- Unique constraint on (title, author) combination
- Thumbnails downloaded from OpenLibrary or stored locally in wwwroot/images/
- Multiple users can own the same book

### UserBook (Library Entry)
- Links User to Book (ownership relationship)
- **Status enum**: Available(1), BeingShared(2), Unavailable(3)
- Users manage their personal library of books
- Only available books can be requested by others

### Share (Lending Transaction)
The core entity representing a book-sharing relationship between lender and borrower.

**Key Properties:**
- `userBookId` - The lender's book being shared
- `borrower` - User ID of the borrower
- `returnDate` - Expected return date (set by lender)
- `status` - Current workflow state

**ShareStatus Workflow:**
1. **Requested** - Borrower requests to borrow → Lender gets notification
2. **Ready** - Lender approves → Book ready for pickup
3. **PickedUp** - Borrower confirms pickup → Book in borrower's possession
4. **Returned** - Borrower returns book → Awaiting lender confirmation
5. **HomeSafe** - Lender confirms receipt → Transaction complete ✓

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Declined** - Lender rejects request (terminal state)
- **Disputed** - Either party raises issue at any stage (terminal state)

**Authorization:**
- Lender-only actions: Ready, HomeSafe, Declined, SetReturnDate
- Borrower-only actions: PickedUp, Returned
- Either party: Disputed, Archive/Unarchive

**Validation Rules:**
- Cannot borrow own books
- Must share a community with book owner
- No duplicate active shares for same book by the same borrower
- Cannot skip workflow stages or move backwards
- Only available books can be requested
- Only terminal states (HomeSafe, Disputed, Declined) can be archived

### ShareUserState (Archive State)
- Tracks per-user archive status for shares
- Allows borrower and lender to independently archive completed shares
- Only terminal states can be archived

### Community
- Groups of users who share books with each other
- Users can join multiple communities
- Book searches are scoped to shared communities (privacy by design)
- Users limited to creating 5 communities
- Creator automatically becomes moderator
- Community deleted when last member leaves

### ChatMessage & ChatThread
- Each share has a dedicated chat thread
- Real-time messaging via SignalR WebSocket
- Message types: user messages + system messages (status changes)
- Rate limited: 30 messages per 2 minutes per user
- Paginated message history (50 per page, max 100)

### Notification
- **Types**: ShareStatusChanged, ShareDueDateChanged, ShareMessageReceived
- Separate read tracking for share vs. chat notifications
- Includes share details, message content, and actor information
- Auto-created when share status changes or messages are sent
- Persists even if share is archived
